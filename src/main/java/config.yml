# This plugin relies on augments. Some are premade. You can create
# custom ones by following the premade structure. 
#
# Each augment is stored in its own file for organizational purposes
# In the TinkersCombat folder, there is a folder called augments. In that folder
# there are two other folders, named weapons, and armor. Those folders contain the
# files for augments of each specified type. 
#
# Each augment will have a recipe. They are made as follows:
#
# recipe:
# 	format:
#	  - 'XXX'
#	  - 'XYX'
# 	  - 'XXX'
#   shaped: true
#   items:
#     X: 'DIAMOND'
# 	  Y: 'NETHER_STAR'
#
# The above augment's recipe will be a nether star surrounded by diamonds
# Please use: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html for materials
#
# Agments wil also have customizable effects.
# For effects:
# Armor augments will have effects for the wearer and
# effects for anyone who attacks the wearer. Effects on the wearer are permanent while
# the armor is equiped. For weapons, there are effects for the attacker, and the target.
# Both of these effects are applied when the attacker attacks and hits. 
# See premade augments for how to set these up. Please use this for effect types
# Duration is the duration of the effect in seconds, level is the power of the potion effect
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html 
#
# Finally, augments will have an item, which is the result of them being crafted. 
# These are self-explanitory and can be seen in the example augments.
